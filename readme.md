# About
Redis-ORM is a database abstraction framework for the redis nonrel datastore for node.js. Much of the API and feature set has been derived from the Google AppEngine's datastore API (python version). Currently on a subset of the features have been implemented but progess towards full compliance is ongoing.

# Usage
I'll expand on this section soon but for now please take a look at the tests included in the project.

# Stable Releases
Currently the project is still in the early stages but once a stable release becomes available they can be found under the tagged releases. Check the release notes contained within for specific features implemented.

# Contributions
Contributions are very well. Please fork this project and submit a pull request with any changes. If you find a bug in the framework, I'd be grateful if you would create an issue for it and submit a small test case showing the problem.
